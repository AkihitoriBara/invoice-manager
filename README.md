# 📊 Invoice Manager - Full Stack Dashboard

A modern, high-performance invoice management system built during my Semester 4 of Computer Science and Engineering. This project focuses on solving real-world data challenges like UTC timestamp synchronization and dynamic financial state management.

## 🚀 The Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js & React with Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions.
- **Backend:** .NET 8 Web API following RESTful principles.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for robust, relational data storage.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a sleek, dark-mode professional aesthetic.

## ✨ Key Features

- **3-Column Workflow:** Seamless navigation from categories to list views to full entry details.
- **Smart Trash System:** Soft-delete logic that allows for restoring entries or permanent database wiping.
- **Dynamic Calculations:** Automatic balance-due updates and status changes (Draft/Paid) based on payment inputs.
- **Data Integrity:** Explicit UTC handling to ensure database consistency across different server environments.

## 🛠️ Lessons Learned

- **Database Migrations:** Transitioning from SQLite to PostgreSQL to handle more complex data types.
- **UX Design:** Implementing "Auto-focus" logic so the app feels responsive when creating new entries.
- **Version Control:** Managing a professional Git workflow, including environment security with `.gitignore`.

## 📈 Roadmap (Future Features)
